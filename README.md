# DDBKit-Template

This is a ready-to-use template for deploying discord bots on macOS, Linux and Windows.

## Getting Started

Everything has already been set up for you, though it's recommended you change [this line of code][PackageVersion] so you're on the [latest version of DDBKit][DDBKitLatest].
> This template was made during v0.x.x versions of DDBKit, so if you're reading this, it's likely on < v1.x.x so you can safely go up to the next minor version. This note just exists in-case someone forgets to update it beforehand.

## Further Reading

For guidance on making your bot, refer to 
[DDBKit](https://github.com/DDBKit/DDBKit) or 
[DDBKit Docs](https://ddbkit.llsc12.me), and
